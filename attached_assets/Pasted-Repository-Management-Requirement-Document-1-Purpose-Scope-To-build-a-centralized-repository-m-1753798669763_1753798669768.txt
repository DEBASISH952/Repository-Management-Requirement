Repository Management Requirement Document
1. Purpose & Scope:
To build a centralized repository management system on Google Drive for systematic upload, organization, and search of digital assets (images, videos, PDFs, etc.).
This will focus on managing current and ongoing monthly additions of approximately 
300 asset units per month.
The assets will include Statics, Carousels, Videos, and Emailers.
2. Key Features
2.1 Google Drive Integration
We will leverage Google Drive for this system, ensuring secure access via authorized login.
Automated or Manual Bulk Upload: We need the ability to fetch and bulk upload assets, ideally from the last 2 months automatically, or manually if needed.
Supported File Types: The system must support various file types including .jpg, .png, .pdf, .mp4, .docx, etc..
Hierarchical Folder Structure: Assets will be automatically sorted and segregated into a clear, hierarchical folder structure within Google Drive. The structure will be:
/Assets/Brand/ (for cross-resort assets), /Assets/Tactical/
Within "Brand" and "Tactical," further sub-folders will be created based on:
State/
Region/
Resort/
Year/ (Example: /Assets/2025/May/) 
Month/ (Example: /Assets/2025/June/) 
Asset Type/ (e.g., Static, Carousel, Video, Emailer)
2.2 Excel Master Tracker & Metadata:
A comprehensive Excel master tracker will be maintained, serving as the central record for all assets. This tracker will include the following agreed-upon parameters (aligned with the Sterling team), which will also serve as asset metadata:
Brand/Tactical
Region
State
Resort
Year
Month
Asset Type
Upload Date 
Unique File Name (as per naming convention below)
Link to Open File (on Google Drive)
Link to Versions Folder (on Google Drive)
Tags/Keywords (manual tagging or using AI-based image/text recognition for search optimization)
2.3 Unique File Naming Convention & Version Control:
Every asset must be assigned a unique name that corresponds to its categorization. The standard format will be:
Year_Month_Region_Resort_AssetType_V[VersionNumber]
Example: 2025_Nov_South_Alleppey_Static_V1
If a specific resort is not applicable (e.g., for a general brand campaign), the "Resort" field can be replaced with "Brand" or omitted as appropriate.
For each asset, there will be an "open file" (the current, approved version).
All previous versions of an asset must be maintained within a dedicated "Versions" sub-folder, clearly linked from the master tracker.
2.4 Search, Filtering & Display:
The system should facilitate efficient search and retrieval.
Search Capabilities: Date-wise search (filter by specific day/week/month/year).
Type-based search (e.g., 'PDFs uploaded in June', 'all images from last week').
Tag/Keyword search across asset metadata (filename, type, custom tags).

2.5 Monthly Asset Sync
- Option to set recurring sync or manual trigger.
2.6 Ease of Use & UX
  - Clean, intuitive UI with:
  - Drag-and-drop upload - To be discussed.
  - Easy previews.
  - Date and type filters in the sidebar.
  - Admin panel for users to tag, rename, or delete assets.
